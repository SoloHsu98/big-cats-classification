      <p class="purpose">
        This project aims to build an image classifier to identify different
        species of big cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The
        model is trained, validated, and tested on a dataset containing images
        of various big cats, which are organized into separate directories for
        training, validation, and testing.

        <p class="list">
          To improve the model's generalization capability, data augmentation
          techniques are applied to the training images. This includes random
          horizontal and vertical flipping and random rotation of the images.

        <p class="list">
          The classifier is built using a custom CNN architecture, which
          consists of the following layers:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Data Augmentation Layer: Applies random transformations to the input
            images to create diverse training examples.
          </li>
          <li>
            Convolutional Layers: Four convolutional layers with ReLU activation
            to extract features from the input images. Each convolutional layer
            is followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions
            and retain the most important features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Global Average Pooling Layer: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the
            feature maps to a single vector.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fully Connected Layer: A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU
            activation to further process the extracted features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dropout Layer: A dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 for
            regularization to prevent overfitting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation
            to classify the images into 10 different categories.
          </li>

        <h3 class="subTitle">Training</h3>
        <p class="list">
          The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical
          cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. An
          EarlyStopping callback is used to monitor the validation loss and stop
          training when the model's performance stops improving, restoring the
          best weights observed during training.

      <div class="para">
        <h3 class="subTitle">Evaluation</h3>
        <p class="list">
          After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess
          its accuracy and loss. The trained model is then saved for future use.

        <p class="list">
          This project demonstrates how to build a robust image classifier using
          a custom CNN architecture. The use of data augmentation and early
          stopping helps in improving the model's performance and generalization
          capability, making it a valuable tool for classifying images of big
          cats.
